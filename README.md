# Domain Focus/Problem Statement
The focus of this project is to design A Python program that will allow users 
to input, process and review their financial transactions in a structured and 
meaningful way

People often struggle with keeping track of their financial decisions and where exactly
their money is going, things such as subscriptions and small bills can add up without
them realizing.

We plan to help people struggling to answer questions like “Where is my money going
each month?” or “Am I overspending on subscriptions?”
